## Assignment Repo
### DO NOT COPY
#### PLEASE ðŸ˜¤

1. This repo is to get ideas only. You should know how each and every line works before copy paste it (better if you don't)
2. The codes are not well optimized. feel free to send pull request, i'll add them in another branch. "master" branch is only for the exact code I submitted as Assignment.
